# MathWiz
MathWiz was designed as apart of my Mobile Computer assignment using Android. 
MathWiz is a simple maths game that displays questions on the screen with four possible answer buttons. 
The goal of the app was to inspire kids to get involved with STEM learning in a fun and interactive way. 
There are three different difficulties including Easy (addition), Medium (simple multiplication), and Hard (difficult multiplication).
