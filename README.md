MathWiz is a simple maths game that displays questions on the screen with four possible answer buttons. The goal of the app was to inspire kids to get involved with STEM learning in a fun and interactive way. There are three different difficulties including Easy (addition), Medium (simple multiplication), and Hard (difficult multiplication).

Each question is created by randomly generating two numbers from 0 to X where X is determined by the difficulty chosen. The difficulty also determines if the numbers are added together, or multiplied. By limiting the size of the numbers and equations for each game mode, it allows kids to practice and gradually improve, hopefully inspiring more kids to be interested in STEM rather than intimidated by it.

Some of the features of the app include:
 - A count-down timer with each correct answer before the time runs out scoring points
 - Leaderboard stored locally on your device with your best scores
 - Background music upon starting the game, and sound effects based upon the users answer.
 - Twitter4J API implementation to allow the user to Tweet their score upon finishing a game.
